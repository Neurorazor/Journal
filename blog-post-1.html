      <h2>Starting My Coding Journey</h2>
      <p>If you're just starting out on your coding journey, you might be feeling a bit overwhelmed. There are so many languages to choose from, so many tools and resources to learn about, and so many experienced programmers out there who seem to know everything already.

But don't worry - everyone has to start somewhere. And one of the best places to start is GitHub.

GitHub is a platform for version control, collaboration, and code hosting. It allows you to store your code online, track changes to your code over time, and collaborate with others on projects. Plus, it's free to use for public repositories!

To get started with GitHub, all you need to do is sign up for an account and create your first repository. You can then start adding files and folders to your repository, committing changes, and pushing your code to GitHub.

But GitHub is just one part of learning to code. You'll also need to choose a programming language to learn, find resources like online courses and tutorials, and start practicing writing code.

It's important to take things one step at a time and not get overwhelmed. Set small goals for yourself, like writing a simple program or building a basic website, and work your way up from there.

And remember - coding is a journey, not a destination. You'll never know everything there is to know, but that's okay. Keep learning, keep practicing, and keep building cool things!</p>
      <p>Today, I decided to take the first step towards becoming a programmer. I've always been interested in computers and technology, but I never thought I could actually learn to code.</p>

      <p>However, after reading a few articles and watching some videos online, I realized that anyone can learn to code with enough practice and dedication.</p>

      <p>So, I signed up for a free GitHub account and started exploring some beginner-friendly coding resources. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me, and I can't wait to start building my own projects.</p>

      <p>Stay tuned for more updates on my coding journey!</p>
